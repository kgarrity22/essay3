            <h3>Hey! This is a digital photo story of my trip to Barcelona last spring break! I've mixed photos of the trip with
                pieces from my essay. I'm also thinking of epanding this and including as similar project related to my essay 2.
                Thanks for checking it out!</h3>

            <p>Ted was easy enough to talk to, but we could feel the empty space that Mariana was supposed to have filled with
                her high
                energy and nearly non-stop chattering.</p>

            <p>“Is this it?” I said as Ted and I exchanged looks. The site, number one recommended by our Airbnb host appeared to just
            be a really tall flag in the middle of a traffic circle. We couldn’t help but laugh, and once we started we couldn’t
            stop. The ridiculousness of the situation was too much.</p>

            <p>With a few destinations in our back pocket, we set out wandering the streets and wondering what it would be like to be a

                myself slowly getting to know Ted, collecting these personal facts and stories from his life and sharing some of my
                own.</p>

            <p>On our last night, we made it our mission to watch the sunset from one of the various lookout points we had found
            through a quick google search. But we’d been slow in our wandering and we reached the base of the hill just as the sun
            was about to set.</p>
